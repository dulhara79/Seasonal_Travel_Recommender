    query = "Hello, I am in the process of planning a deeply meaningful trip to Sri Lanka for my partner and myself, and I feel that generic travel blogs and top-10 lists are failing to provide the nuanced advice I seek. We are both experienced travelers who value authenticity over luxury and immersion over itinerary. I am hoping to find recommendations from individuals or detailed guides that truly understand the soul of this country. Our journey is planned for a duration of approximately sixteen days in the month of February. We are flying into Bandaranaike International Airport and will likely spend our first night near Negombo to recover from the long flight, but we are eager to begin our true adventure the following morning. Our budget is best described as mid-range; we are not backpackers on a shoestring budget, but we also have no interest in five-star resorts. We prefer charming guesthouses, eco-lodges, and homestays where we can interact with local people and get a genuine sense of place. Our interests are quite specific and form the core of this query. We are passionate about landscape photography, so we are constantly in search of breathtaking vistas, unique geological formations, and perfect golden-hour light. This means we value locations that offer panoramic views, whether it's from the top of a mountain, a quiet stretch of coastline, or within an ancient archaeological site. Furthermore, we are both avid hikers and enjoy a good physical challenge. We are not looking for leisurely strolls but rather rewarding day hikes that lead to secluded waterfalls, through misty cloud forests, or up to remote temples. The sense of accomplishment and the opportunity to be in nature are what we crave. Culturally, we are fascinated by history and living traditions. While we will undoubtedly visit the famous sites like the Sigiriya Rock Fortress and the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic in Kandy, we are more intrigued by the less-heralded historical gems. For instance, are there older, less-crowded ruins than Anuradhapura or Polonnaruwa that still hold a powerful atmosphere? We want to understand the layers of Sri Lankan history, from the ancient Sinhalese kingdoms to the colonial influences. Additionally, we are very interested in participating in a local cooking class, not a tourist-oriented one in a hotel, but perhaps in a village home where we can learn to prepare a true Jaffna crab curry or a classic rice and curry meal with a family. Our relationship with wildlife is one of respectful observation. We are keen on ethical wildlife experiences. We want to visit national parks like Yala or Wilpattu for a safari, but we are concerned about the number of jeeps and their impact on the animals. Can you recommend a specific park or a specific safari guide company that practices responsible tourism, maintaining a respectful distance from leopards, elephants, and birds? We are also very interested in birdwatching, particularly in the wetland areas like the Kumana National Park. Finally, we have a dilemma regarding the coastline. We've heard conflicting reports about the best coast to visit in February. Some sources suggest the south coast around Galle and Mirissa is ideal, while others insist the east coast near Arugam Bay is perfect during this season. We are not surfers, but we do appreciate a beautiful, swimmable beach with a laid-back vibe. We want to avoid overly developed party towns. We envision a few days of relaxation at the end of our trip in a quiet beachside location, perhaps in a small cabana, where we can read, swim, and eat delicious fresh seafood. In summary, we are seeking a curated, intelligent travel plan that balances active adventure with cultural depth and peaceful relaxation. We need advice that goes beyond the obvious and helps us connect with the authentic heart of Sri Lanka. Thank you for sharing your expertise and personal experiences to help us craft this unforgettable journey."
